        <p> Fried Chicken  is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, 
            deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken 
            while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>
